/**
 * Provider a resource for managing a team member.
 *
 * > **Note:** Users can no longer be added to a team by their user_id. This field is maintained purely for backwards compatibility.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vercel from "@pulumiverse/vercel";
 *
 * // Recommended: Use email to add team members
 * const example = new vercel.TeamMember("example", {
 *     teamId: "team_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
 *     email: "example@example.com",
 *     role: "MEMBER",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * To import, use the team_id and user_id.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import vercel:index/teamMember:TeamMember example team_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
 * ```
