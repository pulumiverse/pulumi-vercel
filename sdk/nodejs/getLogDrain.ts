/**
 * Provides information about an existing Log Drain.
 *
 * Log Drains collect all of your logs using a service specializing in storing app logs.
 *
 * Teams on Pro and Enterprise plans can subscribe to log drains that are generic and configurable from the Vercel dashboard without creating an integration. This allows you to use a HTTP service to receive logs through Vercel's log drains.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vercel from "@pulumi/vercel";
 *
 * const example = vercel.getLogDrain({
 *     id: "lg_xxxxxxx_xxxxxx_xxxxx",
 * });
 * ```
