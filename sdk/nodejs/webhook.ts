/**
 * A webhook is a trigger-based HTTP endpoint configured to receive HTTP POST requests through events.
 *
 * When an event happens, a webhook is sent to a third-party app, which can then take appropriate action.
 *
 * > Only Pro and Enterprise teams are able to configure these webhooks at the account level.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vercel from "@pulumiverse/vercel";
 *
 * const example = new vercel.Project("example", {name: "example-project"});
 * const example2 = new vercel.Project("example2", {name: "another-example-project"});
 * const withProjectIds = new vercel.Webhook("with_project_ids", {
 *     events: [
 *         "deployment.created",
 *         "deployment.succeeded",
 *     ],
 *     endpoint: "https://example.com/endpoint",
 *     projectIds: [
 *         example.id,
 *         example2.id,
 *     ],
 * });
 * const withoutProjectIds = new vercel.Webhook("without_project_ids", {
 *     events: [
 *         "deployment.created",
 *         "deployment.succeeded",
 *     ],
 *     endpoint: "https://example.com/endpoint",
 * });
 * ```
